# The TiPi PreProcessor


**tpp** is *TiPi PreProcessor* which is used to produce Java code of many TiPi
classes from a single or a few source files.  In TiPi source tree, the files
which need to be pre-processed by `tpp` to produce Java code are suffixed by
`.javax` and are all in the [`src/codegen`](../src/codegen) directory.

The principle of `tpp` is simple: it interprets special pre-processor
directives in the source code and re-emit other lines of code, possibly several
times if the lines appear in a pre-porcessor loop, after performing macro
substitution.  Compared to other programming language pre-processors, `tpp`
provides macros withe immediate and deferred substitution, loops, evaluation of
expressions and can be used to generate almost arbitrary code.


## Calling the Preprocessor

The syntax for calling `tpp` is:

    tpp [OPTIONS] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

to preprocess the source file `INPUT` and produce the destination file
`OUTPUT`.  If omitted or set to `-`, the source (resp. the destination) file is
the standard input (resp.the standard output).

Options in `OPTIONS` are:

* `-Dname=value`: Define a macro (there may be many options of this kind).

* `-a` or `--autopkg`: Guess the Java package from the name of the output file
  and define a macro named `package` with the package name and whose value will
  replace all occurrences of `${package}` in the processed code.

* `-f` or `--docfilter`: Filter JavaDoc comments for unused parameters.

* `--debug`: Turn debug mode on.

* `-h`, `-?` or `--help`: Print a short help message and exit.

* `-v` or `--version`: Print version number and exit.

* `--`: Indicate the end of the options.

Some options are clearly targeted at Java code, but `tpp` can be applied to
other programming languages.


## General Syntax

Pre-processor directives are lines of the form:

    //# COMMAND ...

where, to improve readability, there can be any spaces before `//`, before and
after `#`.  In the output, all lines matching this and with a recognized
`COMMAND` are omitted.

All commands can have and optional comment which is delimited by the first
occurrence of `//` after the `//#`:

    //# COMMAND ... // COMMENT

Both `COMMAND` and `COMMENT` may be empty.  Comment lines are a special case
with an empty `COMMAND` and empty lines like:

    //#

have only spaces (including none) after the `#` and are ignored.


## Macros

Macros are pre-processor variables associated with a value.  Every occurrences
of something like `${NAME}` in the code will be replaced by the actual value of
the macro whose name is `NAME`.  It is an error if `NAME` is not a defined
macro.  Macro substitution is recursive: all occurrences of `${...}` are
replaced by the corresponding value in the processed file until no other
substitutions are possible.  The name of a macro is case sensitive, it starts
with a Latin letter or an underscore character (`a` to `z`, `A` to `Z` or `_`)
which can be followed by any number of Latin letters, underscore characters or
digits (`0` to `9`).

A macro can be redefined (unless it is one of the
[read-only macros](#predefined-macros)) and can be undefined at any time.  It
is also possible to temporarily suspend and resume substitution of a specific
macro.


### Simple Macro Definition

The `def` command defines a macro and takes one of the two following forms:

    //# def NAME  = VALUE // COMMENT
    //# def NAME := VALUE // COMMENT

where `NAME` is the name of the macro, `VALUE` specifies the macro value and
`COMMENT` is an optional comment.  The `VALUE` term may be empty to define the
macro to be an empty string.  Spaces after the assignment operator and after
the `VALUE` term are ignored.

The two possibilities for (re)defining a macro differ in the processing of the
`VALUE` term:

* If the assignment operator is `=`, then all macros are recursively
  substituted in the `VALUE` term before defining the macro `NAME`.

* If the assignment operator is `:=`, then substitutions in the `VALUE` term
  are deferred until `${NAME}` is expanded except that occurrences of `${NAME}`
  in the `VALUE` term are substituted.  This exception is to avoid infinite
  substitution loops but can be exploited to append or prepend stuff to an
  existing macro.  This is of interest when a macro is build piece by piece in
  a loop for instance.  As explained later, this *feature* can also be used to
  [mimic macros with arguments](#macros-as-pseudo-functions).

Note that contrarily to C preprocessor, overwritting an existing definition is
not forbidden.


### Evaluate a Numerical Expression

A macro can be defined by evaluating a numerical expression with the directive:

    //# eval NAME OPER EXPR

where `NAME` is the macro name, `OPER` is an assignment operator and `EXPR` a
numerical expression whose value is computed before (re)defining `NAME` via the
operator.

The expression in `EXPR` is evaluated after recursive macro substitution.  The
syntax of the expression is similar to that of the C (in fact it is implemented
by the `expr` command of Tcl) with a special function `defined(MACRO)` which
yields `true` or `false` depending whether `MACRO` is a defined macro or not.

The operator `OPER` can be a simple `=` to assign the result of evaluating
expression `EXPR` to the macro `NAME` or a composite operator like `OP=` to
assign to `NAME` the result of the expression `${NAME} OP (EXPR)` where `OP`
can be `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<<` or `<<`.

Example:

    //# def a = 1
    //# def b = 4
    //# eval a += ${b}/2

yields a macro named `a` whose value is `3`.

Expressions involve integer arithmetic and tests:

* `defined(NAME)`       check whether macro `NAME` is defined;
* `! defined(NAME)`     check whether macro `NAME` is not defined;
* `EXPR1 || EXPR2`      logical *or* (with lazzy evaluation);
* `EXPR1 && EXPR2`      logical *and* (with lazzy evaluation);
* `"text"`              literal text for string comparison;

Note that macros are recursively substituted if they appear in an expression
including whithin the double quotes of a string.


### Predefined Macros

When processing a file, `tpp` automatically define (and update) the following
macros:

* `${__FILE__}` yields the name of the current processed file.
* `${__LINE__}` yields the current line number in the processed file.
* `${__NEWLINE__}` yields a newline character: "\n".
* `${__SPACE__}` yields a single space character: " ".
* `${__COMMENT__}` yields the comment delimiter.
* `${}` yields an ordinary dollar sign.

These macros are read-only and cannot be redefined.

Macros can also be defined at the command line with the argument `-Dname=value`
where `name` is the name of the macro and `value` its initial value.  There may
be as many such definitions in the command line as needed.


### Undefine Macros

The command:

    //# undef NAME1 NAME2 ...

undefines the macros `NAME1`, `NAME2`, etc.  Until they are redefined, it is an
error to expand these macros.  Read-only macros cannot be undefined.
Undefining a macro which is not defined does nothing.


## Suspend Macro Expansion

The `#def` directive with the `:=` operator only partially expands the value of
a macro.  While this is sufficient for most of the cases, it is sometimes
necessary (or more readable) to temporally suspend the expansion of some
macros.

The command:

    //# suspend NAME1 NAME2 ...

suspends the expansion of the macros `NAME1`, `NAME2`, etc.  Until these macros
are redefined or their expansion resumed with the `#resume` directive, they
will not be expanded.  For instance, the expansion of `${NAME1}` will produce
`${NAME1}`.  Note that it is not required that a macro be defined prior to
suspend its expansion.

As said before, defining a macro (by the `#def` or `#eval` or `#for`
directives) resume the expansion of the macro.  This can also be achieved with
the following directive:

    //# resume NAME1 NAME2 ...


## Conditional Branching

A block of code can be processed or not depending on a logical test using the
`#if` directive and related `#elif` and `#else` directives.  The syntax is as
follows (with an arbitrary number, including none, of `#elif` directives and at
most one `#else` directive):

    //# if EXPR1
    BLOCK1
    //# elif EXPR2
    BLOCK2
    //# else
    BLOCK3
    //# end

where `BLOCK1` is processed if `EXPR1` evaluates to `true`, otherwise `BLOCK2`
is processed if `EXPR2` evaluates to `true`, eventually `BLOCK3` is processed
if neither `EXPR1` nor `EXPR2` evaluate to `true`.  Conditional expressions are
evaluated using the same rules as in the `#eval` directive.


## Loops

A distinctive feature of `tpp` is to provide loops which may be embedded in
other loops to an arbitrarily level.  There are two kinds of loops: `for`-loops
and `while`-loops.

The syntax of a `for`-loop is:

    //# for NAME in EXPR
    ...
    //# end

where `EXPR` is everything after the `in` keyword and up to the end of line or
to the `//` of the optional comment.  After macro substitution of the `EXPR`
term, it is interpreted either as a list of values separated by spaces or as a
range.  The macro `NAME` will successively takes the different values of the
list or of the range and the body of the loop (that is code up to the matching
`end` keyword) will be processed.  If, after macro substitutions, the value of
`EXPR` is an empty list or an empty range, the the body of the loop is just
skipped.

A range of values has the form:

    FIRST : LAST

or

    FIRST : LAST : STEP

where (after macro expansion) `FIRST`, `LAST` and `STEP` are integers, if
omitted, `STEP` is assumed to be `1`.  A zero-`STEP` is forbidden.  Numerical
expressions are not yet supported for these fields but you can use the `#eval`
directive to compute the range parameters.  For instance:

    //# eval last = ${x} + 3*${y}
    //# for i in 0 : ${last} // main loop
    ...
    //# end // end of main loop

Here is another example with a list of values:

    //# def list = blue red yellow orange
    //# for var in ${list}
    //#     emit ${var}
    //# end

where the directive `#emit` directive emits its argument(s) in the output code.

The syntax of `while`-loops is:

    //# while EXPR
    ...
    //# end

which results in processing the boby of the loop until `EXPR` expands to a
false value.

The two following loops are similar (the second being more concise):

    //# def body := dim${k} = ${k}; // the code to expand
    //# def k = 4
    //# while ${k} < 12
    ${boby}
    //#     eval k += 3
    //# end

    //# def body := dim${k} = ${k};
    //# for k in 4:12:3
    ${body}
    //# end

they both produce:

    dim4 = 4
    dim7 = 7
    dim10 = 10

Note how the expansion of `${k}` is deferred by using operator `:=` to define
macro `body`.


## Include Another Source File

The contents of another source file can be processed at any place by using the
`#include` directive:

    //# include WHAT

where `WHAT` (after recursive macro expansion) takes one of the two forms:
`<FILENAME>` or `"FILENAME"`.  The result is as if the contents of the file
`FILENAME` be inserted in place of the command.  A restriction is that
directives operating on blocks (`#if ... `, `#for ...` and `#while ...`) must
be open and closed in a single included file.


## Emitting Code or Printing Messages

The command:

    //# emit CODE

substitutes macros in `CODE` and prints it to the output file.

Commands:

    //# echo MESG
    //# warn MESG

substitute macros in `MESG` and print it.  Command `#echo` uses the standard
output stream while `#warn` uses the standard error stream.

It may be useful to examine the contents of some macros (without a fully
recursive expansion).  To that end, the directive

    //# debug MESG

prints `MESG` after a *single round* of macro substitution on the standard error
stream.

The `#error` command:

    //# error MESG

substitutes macros in `MESG` and prints it on the standard error stream with
the line number and the name of the processed file and then aborts the
processing.


## Examples

### Variable Length Lists

The following example builds a list of dimensions:

    //# def dims =  // start with an empty list
    //# def sep  =  // and an empty separator
    //# for k in 1 : ${rank}
    //#     def dims = ${dims}${sep}dim${k}
    //#     def sep = ,${__SPACE__}
    //# end

and yields a macro named `dims` with contents `dim1, dim2, ...`.  Note the use
of an auxiliary macro `sep` and of the predefined macro `__SPACE__` to nicely
separate the elements of the list.  Another possibility is to write:

    //# if ${rank} < 1
    //#     def dims =  // result is an empty list
    //# else
    //#     def dims = dim1 // initial list
    //#     for k in 2 : ${rank}
    //#         def dims = ${dims}, dim${k}
    //#     end
    //# end


### Macros as Pseudo-Functions

Deferred substitution can be used as follows:

    //# def list := ${prefix}1
    //# for k in 2 : 3
    //#     def list := ${list},${prefix}${k}
    //# end

which yields a macro `list` whose contents is
`${prefix}1,${prefix}2,${prefix}3`.  Note that, at this stage, `prefix` does
not need to be defined.  The macro `list` can then be used as a template to
make lists after substitution of the `prefix` macro:

    //# def prefix  = foo
    //# def FooList = ${list}
    //# def prefix  = bar
    //# def BarList = ${list}

which yields `foo1,foo2,foo3` and `bar1,bar2,bar3` for the respective contents
of macros `FooList` and `BarList`.

With this kind of trick it is also possible to mimic the behavior of
macros with arguments (even though it is less readable).

To build the macro `list` above, we may also suspend the expansion of the macro
`prefix`:

    //# suspend prefix
    //# def list = ${prefix}1
    //# for k in 2 : 3
    //#     def list = ${list},${prefix}${k}
    //# end

As (re)defining `prefix` will automatically resume macro expansion, it is not
necessary to have a `#resume prefix` command.

## Future Evolution

1. It may be useful to customize the syntax in order to accomodate to
   various programming languages.  For instance:

   * `@name@`       to interpolate a macro;
   * `@@`           for a single `@`;
   * `#@ COMMAND`   for preprocessor directives;

2. Macros with arguments (spaces stripped): `${macro(arg1,arg2,...)}`

3. String functions (like predefined macros).

    ${substr(str,i1,i2,subs)}
    ${strmatch(string,pattern)}
    ...

4. Allow for numerical expressions in ranges (taking care of the ternary
   operator).
