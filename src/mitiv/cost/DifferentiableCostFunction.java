     * Compute the value of the cost function and its gradient.

     * <p>
     * This method is intended to compute the value and the gradient of a
     * cost function which are needed by limited memory non-linear optimization
     * methods like the non-linear conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods
     * such as L-BFGS.
     * <p>
     * The rationale of the {@code alpha} and {@code clear} arguments is to
     * let one builds a composite cost function efficiently.  Below is the
     * pseudo-code of an example which shows how to compute the value and the
     * gradient of a function which is a linear combination of other functions
     * (in the array {@code f}) with different multipliers (in the array
     * {@code alpha}):
     *
     * <pre>
     *     DifferentiableCostFunction[] f;
     *     double[] alpha;
     *     Vector x;
     *     Vector gx;
     *     double fx;
     *     fx = 0.0;
     *     for (int j = 0; j < f.length; ++j) {
     *         fx += f[j].computeCostAndGradient(alpha[j], x, gx, (j == 0));
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Note that the gradient vector has to be cleared for the first
     * ({@code j == 0}) function of the list.
     *
     * @param alpha - A non-negative multiplier for the cost.
     * @param x     - The vector of variables (must belongs to the input space of the
     *                cost function).
     * @param gx    - The vector to store the gradient of the cost function times the
     *                weight  (must belongs to the input space of the cost function).
     * @param clr   - Indicate whether the gradient vector has to be cleared (that is,
     *                filled with zeros) prior to the computation.  If false, the
     *                contents of the gradient vector is incremented with the gradient
     *                of the cost function (times {@code alpha}).
     * 
     * @return The value of the cost function times the weight.
