/**
 * Interface for cost functions implementing their proximal operator.
 * 
 * The proximal operator of a function {@code f : R^n -> R^n} is defined by:
 * <pre>
 *     prox_f(x) = argmin_y { f(y) + (1/2) ||x - y||^2 }
 * </pre>
 * Functions for which the proximal operator can be computed can be minimized
 * even though there are non-smooth and thus non-differentiable.  They are
 * notably useful to implement constraints or to impose sparsity. See reference
 * below for a review.
