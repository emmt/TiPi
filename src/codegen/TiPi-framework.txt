# Introduction

TiPi is a Java *Toolkit for Inverse Problems and Imaging* developed by
the [MiTiV](http://mitiv.univ-lyon1.fr/) project.


## Basic vector operations

* create a new vector
* copy vector contents from/to conventional memory^(a)^
* fetch/set the value of a specific element^(a)^
* fill a vector with a value
* copy (duplicate) a vector
* compute the dot product of two vectors
* copy vector contents to another vector
* swap the contents of two vectors
* scale a vector by a scalar
* compute linear combinations of 2 or 3 vectors
* compute the norm(s) of a vector

(a)
: These operations are not guaranteed to be efficient, their usage
  should be limited, for instance to set the inputs of an algorithm
  and to recover its result.


## Rationale and Performances Issues

Vectors are intended to have a limited set of methods.  These methods
are just those which are needed by optimization methods and merely
correspond to the properties of
"[*vectors*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space)" in the
conventional linear algebra sense.  Hence the name of these objects in
TiPi.

Thanks to these restrictions, "*vectors*" can be implemented in forms
suitable for performances (non-conventional or distributed memory,
etc.) and a particular implementation is simplified by the fact that
only a few methods have to be exposed.

However, "*vectors*" are not really adpated for the many manipulations
required to prepare the inputs of the algorithms (e.g., reading
images, converting types, perform zero-padding, recentering, etc.) and
to save the result (e.g., extracting parts, rescaling, writing to a
file, etc.).  This is why TiPi provides another type of objects: the
shaped arrays.  These objects are much more versatile and use
conventional memory.  We were careful so that their manimpulation
should be efficient but not to the sacrifice of flexibility.

Typically, an algorithm written in the TiPi framework, starts with
shaped arrays, do some pre-processing, create vectors from the input
arrays, run the iterative method, copy the result into a shaped array,
display and/or save the shaped array, perhaps after some
post-processing.

## Basic Operations on Vectors

To create a shaped-vector from the contents of the array

    space.create(arr)

where `arr` can be: a `ShapedArray` (with same shape, automatically
converted to the correct type), a flat Java vector (with the same
number of elements, type is automatically converted).  To spare
memory, the result may a wrapping of the source and thus may share its
contents with it, but there is no guarantee of that.  To make sure
that the two object have independent contents, use:

    space.create(arr, forceCopy)

To convert to a flat Java vector (of known element type) do one of:

    vec.flatten()
    vec.flatten(forceCopy)

Thus a shaped array may be reformed by one of:

    ShapedArray arr = ShapedArray.create(vec);
    ShapedArray arr = ShapedArray.wrap(vec.flatten(), vec.cloneShape(), false);

with variants:

    FloatArray fltArr = FloatArray.createFrom(fltvec);
    DoubleArray dblArr = DoubleArray.createFrom(dblVec);

assuming:

    FloatShapedVector fltVec;
    DoubleShapedVector dblVec;

{==So there must be some copyFrom/copyTo for ShapedArray and ShapedVector
which are optimized if the contents are the same...==}

Assuming that `arr` is a `ShapedArray`, the reason to distinguish:

    vec = space.create(arr);

and

    vec = space.create();
    vec.assign(arr);

is that, although the two fragments of code result in a vector with
the same contents as the array, the first fragment of code may have a
chance to avoid duplicating memory, while the second yields independent
contents.  In fact, the second fragment of code is equivalent to:

    vec = space.create(arr, true); // force copy

Since we want to be able to store vectors in non-conventional memory
(e.g. GPU) , there are no guaranteed means to share contents between
an array and a vector.  Thus, to recover the contents of a vector
after some computations, you must call, either:

    arr.assign(vec);

to make sure the contents of the existing array match that of the
vector, or:

    arr = ShapedArray.create(vec);

which creates a new array from a shaped vector.  These operations are
optimized, so there is a chance that they costs almost nothing (if the
existing array and the vector share their contents or if the vector
contents can be wrapped into an array), however this cannot be
guaranteed.


# Shaped Arrays[ShapedArray]

A `ShapedArray` stores rectangular multi-dimensional arrays of
elements of the same data type.  Compared to a `ShapedVector`, the
elements of a `ShapedArray` reside in conventional memory and may be
stored in arbitrary order and in a non-contiguous way.


## Class Hierarchy

Various abstract classes extend the base class `ShapedArray` depending
on whether the type and/or the rank[^rank] (that is the number of
dimensions) are unveiled.  The naming conventions are:

    ShapedArray   // base class, neither rank nor type is known
    <Type>Array   // a shaped array of known type, but any rank
    Array<Rank>D  // a shaped array of known rank, but any type
    <Type><Rank>D // a shaped array with known type and rank

where the `<Type>` field is the capitalized name of the primitive type
(*e.g.* `Double` for `double`, `Int` for `int`, *etc.*) and `<Rank>`
is a decimal number in the range 1-9.  Arrays representating scalars
are also needed, as `0D` is a bit odd for 0-rank (that is scalar)
object it is replaced by the substantive `Scalar` in the rules above
for 0-rank arrays and a `Scalar` denotes a scalar of any type.  For
instance:

* `FloatArray` is an array of float's;
* `Array3D` is a three-dimensional array;
* `Scalar` is a scalar of any type;
* `DoubleScalar` is a 0-rank array to access a single double precision
  value;
* `Long4D` is a four-dimensional array of long integer values;

All these classes are abstract, the actual class depends on the
storage of the elements of the array.


## Basic Operations on Shaped Arrays

The operations available for a `ShapedArray`, say `arr`, are the same
as those of `Shaped` and `Typed` objects:

    arr.getType()        // query the type of the array
    arr.getRank()        // query the rank of the array
    arr.getNumber()      // query the number of elements in the array
    arr.getDimention(k)  // query the length of the (k+1)-th dimension
    arr.getOrder()       // query the storage order of the elements in the array
    arr.cloneShape()     // query a copy of the shape of the array

and type conversion:

    arr.toByte()         // convert to ByteArray
    arr.toShort()        // convert to ShortArray
    arr.toInt()          // convert to IntArray
    arr.toLong()         // convert to LongArray
    arr.toFloat()        // convert to FloatArray
    arr.toDouble()       // convert to DoubleArray

For efficiency reasons, conversion operations are *lazzy*: they return
the same object if it is already of the correct type.  Use the `copy`
method to duplicate an array:

    arr.copy()           // duplicate the contents of the array

This method yields a new shaped array which has the same shape, type
and values as `arr` but whose contents is independent from that of
`arr`.  If `arr` is a *view*, then the `copy` method yields a compact
array in a *flat*[^flat] form.

{==TODO==} It is possible to assign the values of an array from
another object:

    arr.assign(src)

where `src` is another shaped array, a shaped vector, or a Java array
of a primitive type.  If the type of the elements of `src` does not
match that of the elements of `arr`, conversion is automatically and
silently performed.  The shape of `src` must however match that of
`arr` ({==broadcasting rules may be implemented later==}).  The `copy`
operation is optimized: if `arr` and `src` share their contents with
the same storage, nothing is done as nothing has to be done.  If `arr`
and `src` share their contents in a different form, the result is
impredictible.


## Operations Available for Arrays with Unveiled Type

Add/subtract/multiply elements by a scalar:

    arr.increment(value)
    arr.decrement(value)
    arr.scale(value)

Fill with given or generated value:

    arr.fill(value)
    arr.fill(generator)

Map a function to every elements:

    arr.map(func)

Scan all the elements of the array:

    arr.scan(scanner)

Extract the contents as a flat Java vector:

    arr.flatten([forceCopy])


## Other Operations

Fetch a value:

    arr.get(i1,...,ir)

element type and rank must be known so `arr` is an instance of some
`<Type><Rank>D` abstract class.

Assign a value to an element:

    arr.set(i1,...,ir, value)


### Slicing

    arr.slice([which,] index)

By default `which` = `LAST` (-1) to slice through the last dimension,
result is an array of same data type with one less dimension (slicing
a `Float3D` yields a `Float2D`, slicing a `Double1D` yields a
`DoubleScalar`, *etc.*), the operation is fast as it returns a view
on `arr`.


### Ranged Sub-array

You can make a sub-array for given ranges of indices:

    arr.view(rng1, rng2, ..., rngr)

which returns a view to `arr` limited to the elements indexed by the
ranges `rng*` are either `Range` objects or `null` which means
"*all*".

A range is a construction like:

    Range rng = new Range(start, stop);

or:

    Range rng = new Range(start, stop, step);

where `start` is the initial index of the range, `stop` is the last
index and `step` is optional and defaults to +/-1 depending on the
ordering of the endpoints `start` and `stop`.

As in Java, indexes of a range start at `0` (also `Range.FIRST`) but
may be negative.  Starting/ending indexes of a range are interpreted
as offsets relative to the length of the dimension of interest if they
are strictly negative.  That is `-1` (also `Range.LAST`) is the last
element along a dimension, `-2` is the penultimate element, *etc.*
This rule is however only applied once: if `j` is a start/stop index,
then *j* (if *j* >= 0) or *j*+*n* (if *j* < 0) with *n* the length of
the dimension) must be greater or equal 0 and strictly less than *n*,
the length of the dimension of interest.

The convention is that the element corresponding to the first index of
a range is always considered while the last one may not be reached.
In pseudo-code, the rules are:

    if (step > 0) {
        for (int index = first; index <= last; index += step) {
            ...
        }
    } else if (step < 0) {
        for (int index = first; index >= last; index += step) {
            ...
        }
    }

The step may have the special value `0` to use a step equals to +/-1
depending on the ordering of the first and last element of the range
after taking into account the length of the dimension of interest.
Otherwise, the sign of the step must be in agreement with the ordering
of the first and last element of the range.

To ease the construction of ranges and make the code more readable,
we recommend to use a range factory, *e.g.*:

    static public Range range(int start, int stop) {
        return new Range(start, stop);
    }
    static public Range range(int start, int stop, int step) {
        return new Range(start, stop, step);
    }

Then a ranged view of an array can be written as:

    arr.view(range(0,-1,2), range(4,8))

which is lighter.


### Selected Sub-array

Likewise:

    arr.view(sel1, sel2, ..., selr)

returns a view to arr from a selection of indices, all `sel*` are
either `int[]` index list or `null` which means "*all*".  Beware that
in selections of indicess, all indices must be reachable (`-1` is
considered as out-of-bounds).

To ease the construction of such views and make the code more
readable, you can also use selection factories like:

    static public int[] select(int i1) {
        return new int[]{i1};
    }
    static public int[] select(int i1, int i2) {
        return new int[]{i1, i2};
    }
    static public int[] select(int i1, int i2, int i3) {
        return new int[]{i1, i2, i3};
    }
    ...

and write something like:

     arr.view(select(3,2,9), select(5,1))

Note that sub-arrays and slices are views to the original array (which
can itself be a view) with fast access to the elements of this array.
If you do not want that the view and its parent share the same
elements, use the `copy()` method after making the view.

It is currently not possible to mix ranges, slicing and index
selection in a single su-array construction, as it would result in too
many possibilities (and potentially inefficient code).  It is however
possible to chain sub-array-constructions to obtain the same effect.
For instance:

    arr.view(null, range(2,11,3)).view(select(6,4,8,2), null)

to mimic:

    arr.view(select(6,4,8,2), range(2,11,3))

which is not allowed for now.
